For our search.html page query we used the like predicate to query for  %title% , %director%, and %starsname% (All strings that contain the pattern ) 
However, to query for movie year we used movie = year

For our browse.html we used the like predicate to query for all titles that start with title% 

To search for the genres we used the like predicate to query for %genre%  (All strings that contain the pattern) 


Example query: use moviedb;
SELECT   
            				movies.title,   
            				movies.year,   
            				movies.director,   
            		        GROUP_CONCAT(stars.name) AS 'star',   
            		        GROUP_CONCAT(stars.id) AS 'starid',  
            		        GROUP_CONCAT( distinct genres.name) AS 'genres',
                            ratings.rating 
            		          
            		FROM movies  
            		LEFT OUTER JOIN stars_in_movies ON movies.id = stars_in_movies.movieId  
            		LEFT OUTER JOIN stars ON stars_in_movies.starId = stars.id  
            		LEFT OUTER JOIN genres_in_movies ON movies.id = genres_in_movies.movieId  
            		LEFT OUTER JOIN genres ON genres_in_movies.genreId = genres.id 
                    LEFT OUTER JOIN ratings ON movies.id = ratings.movieId
            		WHERE title like '%Sky%'
					GROUP BY   
            						movies.title;
