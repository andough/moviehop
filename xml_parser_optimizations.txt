optimizations for xml parse
1. used dom parser over sax parser to further reduce running time by loading entire file in memory. 
Few improvements to running time and uses more memory.
2. batch insert when possible to make program more efficient by reducing overhead required when sending an insert to mysql. 
larger improvements to running time based on the number of executes saved
3. cache list of actors as a hashmap to reduce number of calls and repetitive searches to mysql. 
Most significant changes in running time by using only 1 query to sql versus a query for every entry. 
While this reduces running time however, it uses a lot of memory to store entire table into the hashmap.
4. cache most recent query for movie search to prevent making the same call. 
This made significant improvements when parsing CastParser since the format of the xml is ordered by movie.
